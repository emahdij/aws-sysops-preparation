# Chapter 1: Monitoring and Observability

## Overview

Effective monitoring is essential for AWS environments to ensure reliability, performance, and security. This chapter covers AWS monitoring services with a focus on practical implementation.

## AWS Services Covered

| Service | Primary Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **CloudWatch** | Collection and tracking of metrics, logs, and events |
| **CloudTrail** | AWS API call recording and auditing |
| **AWS Config** | Resource inventory, configuration history, and compliance |
| **EventBridge** | Event-driven architectures and automation |
| **X-Ray** | Application tracing and performance analysis |

<!-- ## Monitoring Best Practices

- **Full-Stack Monitoring**: Monitor all layers from infrastructure to application
- **Proactive Alerts**: Set thresholds based on business impact
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs for comprehensive analysis
- **Automated Remediation**: Create automated responses to common issues
- **Cost-Optimized Monitoring**: Balance monitoring depth with cost implications
- **Resource Tagging**: Use consistent tagging to organize and filter monitoring resources -->
